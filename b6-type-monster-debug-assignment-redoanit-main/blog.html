<h3>1) local storage vs session storage</h3>
<p>sessionStorage is similar to localStorage ; the difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in
    sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a document is loaded in a particular tab in the
    browser,
    a unique page session gets created and assigned to that particular tab.</p>

<h3>2) Global scope vs Block scope</h3>
<p>In a browser environment, the global scope is controlled by the window object while in Node. js, it's controlled by
    the global object. Block scopes are what you get when you use if statements, for statements, and the like.</p>
